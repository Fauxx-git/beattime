Here is the script for your current beattime and a beattime converter.
The defaults are set to UTC+1

When you call the script you have 3 option
No argument: You get your beattime
    -tz: Your timezone it is defaulted to 1 signifying UTC+1
-b: Give an integer or float and you will get your given beattime in UTC+1
    to edit this you have to edit the function beat-to-UTC (for now)

Next Update will be DST (painfully)

Thanks to Andy Kaufman and Punp from Agora
